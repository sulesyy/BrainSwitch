 İs an iOS application designed to help users test and improve their mental awareness and concentration levels. This project was developed using Swift and Xcode as part of Angela Yu’s iOS Development Bootcamp.  


What Does the App Do?

 Provides users with mental exercises at different difficulty levels.  
 
Tracks performance with an instant feedback and scoring system.  

 Saves user scores to monitor progress over time.  
 
Offers a simple and interactive interface to enhance user experience.  

 What We Did in the Project

 UI Design: Created the app interface using Storyboard.  
 
Game Logic: Managed scores, levels, and test flow with the class-based `GameManager`.  

Timer: Controlled test durations with `TimerManager`.  

Score Tracking: Saved and displayed user scores using `ScoreManager`.  

Feedback:Provided visual and audio feedback for correct/incorrect answers.  


Technologies Used

Swift – Programming language
